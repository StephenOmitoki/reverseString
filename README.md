# reverseString

Showcasing my ability to learn assembly language by reversing the string "Stephen Omitoki" and displaying it ("ikotimO nehpetS"). It pushes each character onto the stack, pops them back in reverse order to modify the string, and prints the result with WriteString. Assembling and linking with Irvine32.lib runs it on Windows, showcasing my grasp of loops, stack operations, and memory manipulation.
